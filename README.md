# vite-tailwind-daisyui-boilerplate

## Project Overview

This project, "vite-tailwind-daisyui-boilerplate", is a modern web application built with React. It uses Vite as a build tool, which provides a faster and leaner development experience. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces, and DaisyUI, a plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of UI components.

The project uses ESLint for static code analysis to quickly find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. It has additional ESLint plugins configured for enforcing best practices in React and React Hooks. It also uses the eslint-plugin-react-refresh for enforcing best practices for React Refresh, which is a feature that allows you to get near-instant feedback for changes in your React components.

The project uses PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript, and Autoprefixer, a PostCSS plugin that adds vendor prefixes to your CSS.

The TypeScript definitions for React and ReactDOM are included as development dependencies, which suggests that this project may be using TypeScript.

The scripts defined in the package.json allow you to start a development server (dev), build the project for production (build), lint the project files (lint), and preview the production build locally (preview).
